# AirBnB Clone - Web Static
### Overview
Welcome to the Web Static phase of the AirBnB clone project! In this stage, I will be focusing on developing the front-end of the application by creating simple HTML static pages and a style guide. This step is crucial in bringing the AirBnB objects created earlier to life on the web.

# Project Details
Title: AirBnB Clone - Web Static
Technologies: HTML, CSS
Front-end Developer: Ipadeola Bamidele Michael
Weight: 1
Project Duration: Dec 14, 2023, 6:00 AM - Dec 19, 2023, 6:00 AM

# Background Context
Web Static, What?
Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive! Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything
During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page; it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. It's essential to fix your HTML part before starting the styling since, without any structure, you can’t apply any design.

# Learning Objectives

- What is HTML
- How to create an HTML page
